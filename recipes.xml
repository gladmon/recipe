</Title><Ingredients>4 eggs
Duncan Hines vanilla cake mix
1 pkg dream whip
1 c. water
1-1/2 teaspoons vanilla
1-1/2 pounds butter (6 sticks)
6 c. flour
1-3/4 c. sugar
3 teaspoons cinnamon
4-1/2 teaspoons vanilla (1 tablespoon + 1-1/2 tea.)</Ingredients><Directions>Preheat oven 350
Grease &amp; Flour large pan (17 x 11 x3)
Soften sticks of butter - must be plyable- (room temp for 1 hour or microwave for  60 secs)

Cake:
Beat eggs six minutes
Add cake mix, dream whip, water &amp; vanilla - Mix well- Pour into greased pan
Bake 20 minutes - until golden brown- Remove from oven

Topping:
    Mix flour, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon &amp; soften butter by hand till well mixed.
 
If butter is very soft it will form a wet mass, if butter is a little harder it will be more crumbly. Drop by pieces on top of hot cake. I literally just rub it between my hands and let it fall making sure all the surface of the cake is covered.

Bake an additional 20 minutes - turn oven off
Let cake rest in oven till your ready to serve. I&apos;ve been known to go to bed and cut it in the morning. (I do check to make sure the topping is not to brown. It will appear a white-ish brown in center and darker as you get to the edges. You really can not mess this cake up. I have tried using 1/2 brown sugar &amp; white sugar and I could not detect a difference in taste.

8 tablespoons of crisco (unflavored)

3 eggs
3 teaspoons of vanilla
3 teaspoons of baking powder
3 cups flour
ICING
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon melted butter (10-15 sec. in microwave)
1 cup of 10x sugar (1/4 cup at a time)
1 teaspoon of water for each 1/4 cup (3 teaspoons = 1 table spoon)
Sprinkles  any kind will do
</Ingredients><Directions>Preheat oven 350

Cream: margarine/butter and crisco

Add: 10x sugar &amp; eggs (1 at a time), vanilla
Mix:  flour with baking powder
Add: gradually to mix - till the dough does not stick to your hands (you will need to roll it, you may need to use up to 5cups of flour) I usually add a 1/2 cup at at time, one of these batches had 3 1/2 cups and one 4 1/4 cups

Bake on ungreased cookie sheet till golden on bottom.   10-12 minutes
The top may or may not get brown.  We used to put them under the broiled for a few seconds when I was little, that was when the broiler was located at the bottom of the oven in a separate area.

Cool on rack  I have icined them the next day or hours later. I will store them for several days in an air tight container and then icing.

Icing
I mix the juice and butter by hand till well blended then add sugar a little bit at a time so it is easer to mix.  The icing will be a liquid - not to thin 

Brush, spoon, dip any way you want to get the icing on the cookie  I have tried it several ways and it is still messy  I usually put them back on the cookie sheet(on a rack) to dry and sprinkle them with colored sugars or multi colored beads,  all of it works.

Store in a air tight container.  They seem to freeze well.</Directions><FromName>Elisa</FromName><Category></Category><Serves></Serves><Created>12/15/2009 7:40:10 PM</Created><Modified>12/22/2011 6:19:29 PM</Modified><Deleted>false</Deleted><ID>81</ID></Table><Table><Title>Breakfast Scramble
